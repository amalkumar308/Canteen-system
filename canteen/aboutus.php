	<h1><b><i>About Canteen</i></b></h1>
	The school canteen is a great place to promote an enjoyment of healthy eating. For students who use the canteen regularly, the food purchased makes 
	a significant contribution to their total food intake and nutrition; therefore it makes sense to ensure the best food possible is available to enhance their
	ability to learn and take in the information presented to them in class.

	For students who don’t use the canteen regularly, the canteen still plays an important educational and modelling role for healthy eating habits.

	There are many aspects of a child’s life that may be restricted in an educational setting. For example: the type of reading material accessed in 
	the library, internet access and visual material (DVD) and the clothes they wear. It is appropriate to restrict unhealthy food in an educational setting.
	The canteen also plays an important role within the broader school environment – that of reinforcing knowledge, skills and behaviours about healthy eating 
	and lifestyle which are taught in the classroom. Food provided at school has a considerable influence on the development of children’s long-term eating
	habits, food preferences and attitudes towards food. The school canteen plays a vital role in promoting healthy foods and creating a school culture 
	of healthy eating.

	Food preferences are developed in childhood. By promoting and encouraging healthier food choices during childhood, it is anticipated that healthy 
	eating habits will be carried through to adulthood and may go some way to help prevent chronic disease later in life. The focus of the NHSC project is
	to encourage the development and reinforcement of healthy eating patterns at school, promoting a balanced healthy eating pattern rather than focusing 
	on weight management.

		<h1><b><i>Nutrition</i></b></h1>
		In the nutrition section we will :

				Briefly define what nutrition is
				Describe some of the factors that affect food intake
				Classify food according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating
				Define what the nutrients of interest are in regards to decreasing the risk of chronic disease, and
				Identify some of the nutrients we need to pay attention to, especially those of relevance to children.

		Note: Important to acknowledge at this stage that it is recognised that most canteen managers will have some basic knowledge of nutrition. The
		purpose of this section is to ensure that all participants are at the same level. The activities are designed to recognise and make use of their prior
		knowledge.

		Nutrition is a 3-part process
				Food or drink is consumed
				The body breaks down the food or drink into nutrients
				The nutrients travel through the bloodstream to different parts of the body where they are used as ‘fuel’ and for many other purposes

		Nutrition is complex. It involves the journey of food, drink, nutrients, and waste products through the whole body from ingestion to excretion. 

		Nutrients travel through the bloodstream to different parts of the body where they are used as fuel and for many other purposes. To give the body
		proper nutrition, a person has to consume enough of the foods that contain key nutrients.
